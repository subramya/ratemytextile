<p> Hemp is a natural plant fiber from the stems of the Cannabis plant.
    In terms of sustainability, hemp is the least harmful to the environment.
    The hemp crop requires little water to grow and replenishes soil nutrients to help improve soil health.
    It is also biodegradable and is one of the stronger textile fabrics.
    What’s more, hemp fabric offers insulating, anti-radiation, and anti-bacterial properties. </p>

<p> Second only to hemp, the flax plant is the world’s most productive crop per hectare,
    outperforming cotton crops and making better use of the land. Organic linen is grown using a
    system of crop rotation, which ensures the soil is protected and prevents soil degeneration,
    as well as looking after important eco-systems. </p>
